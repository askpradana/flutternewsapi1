As a business person, I want my news is already selected that only the most interesting that I will read, that I am a busy person.

As an ordinary person, I want my news is cluttered and also I want to read any interesting that went viral, You know Im the person that have fear of missing out!.

As a person, I only want to read my news, I dont want to setting anything, install and I already can read my news, fast.
